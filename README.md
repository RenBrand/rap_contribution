This is a simple example project which tries to detach parts from a Workbench to a new browser window (via Drag&Drop).

The implementation is **not** fully working, it's just a POC. Just import the project in your eclipse and launch the "at.renbrand.rap.workbench.demo.launch".
An slightly modified Example-Mail application will open which allows you to detach a Message-Part to a new Browser window.

**Caution**: Be sure your browser allows Popups form 127.0.0.1, because otherwise it will not work and a JavaScript error will be displayed.
